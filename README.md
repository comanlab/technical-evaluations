# Technical Evaluations

Welcome to CiCL's technical evaluation repo ðŸ‘‹ Its contents include tasks that we use to evaluate technical backgrounds of research assistant candidates.

## For Research Assistant Candidates

We are excited to see how you think about solving the sorts of problems we face in pursuing our research. The majority of our technical work focuses on either infrastructure development or big data analysis, and we've designed minimal projects related to both that will help us evaluate your technical skills before joining CiCL.

We ask that you spend **no more than 3 hours** on **one** minimal project. We do not expect you to provide a full end-to-end solution, and are most interested in the decisions you make to approach solving the problem, including _why_.

The choices:

- [Focus: Infrastructure](choices/infrastructure.md)
- [Focus: Data Analysis](choices/data-analysis.md)

When completing your minimal project's tasks, make sure to document your code and maintain readability&mdash;the entire research community benefits from code they can read, understand, and reuse.

### Submission

You may submit your solution in any format you'd like (e.g., via email attachment or a GitHub repo). We encourage you to make your submission as reproducible as possible, but will not be evaluating you on that.

### Questions or Issues?

Please reach out to Ari via email with any questions or issues you run into. While this is an evaluation of your technical skills, it doesn't mean you can't ask for help!
